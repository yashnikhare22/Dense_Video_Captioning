# Dense_Video_Captioning

# Introduction
This project aims to generate captions for videos by associating each time step with a caption instead of generating a single caption for the entire video. The project uses a dense video captioning model that generates multiple captions for each time step, which are then scored and ranked to produce a final caption for the time step.
